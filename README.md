# TYPO3-onetimeaccount-adressstatus
Additional radio buttons for "onetimeaccount/seminars" to classify an address as private or business. Based on extension sample marijo from One-time FE account 1.0.
This Extension works now with TYPO3 8.7 and One-time account 4.1.1.
It is only alpha status and only as sample for your own extension. I can offer no support.
